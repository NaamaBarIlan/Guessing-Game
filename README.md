# Single Player Guessing Game

A C# single-player guessing game.

## Description
This is a single-player game where the player has a finite number of guesses to try
and guess all the letters that make up a secret word. 

After printing an introductory message explaining the game to the player, the program selects a secret word at random. Then the
player does a series of turns. In each turn, the player guesses a letter from A-Z. Incorrect guesses are displayed as an evolving picture of the player. For
each incorrect guess, a new part of a stick figure—first the head, then the body, then each arm, each leg, and finally each foot—is added until the picture is complete.
